#Movie Recommendation System

Overview
The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. This system utilizes various recommendation techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations.

Features
User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies by finding similar users and suggesting movies that those users liked.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similarity between movies.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies by analyzing the features of the movies themselves, such as genres, actors, and directors.
Model:content-based filtering recommendations.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.



The script primarily uses the following algorithms and techniques for the Movie Recommendation System:
Text Preprocessing and Stemming:
Porter Stemmer: 
Used for stemming words to their root forms to improve the effectiveness of text matching.
Vectorization:
Bag of Words (BoW) with CountVectorizer: 
Converts the textual tags (which include genres, keywords, cast, crew, and overview) into numerical vectors. This is a standard method for converting text data into a format that can be used for machine learning.
Similarity Measurement:
Cosine Similarity: 
Calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors, used here to measure the similarity between movies based on the vectorized tags.
